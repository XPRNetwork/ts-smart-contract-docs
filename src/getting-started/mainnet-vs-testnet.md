# Testnet vs mainnet 

Like many other blockchains, XPRNetwork has two chains, the testnet and the mainnet. As you can guess, testnet is a version of XPRNetwork where you can test things. Testnet is a fabulous playground, it allows you to perform the exact same operation as mainnet with a little less power but you will not notice it ðŸ™‚.

You should always consider building on testnet before deploying mainnet, itâ€™s the best way to ensure your app can run on lower performance, if itâ€™s run smoothly on testnet, it will be blazingly fast on mainnet.

Switching between mainnet or testnet is made by selecting the node in most cases. For the front-end app using the @proton/web-sdk or @proton/react-native-sdk, you have to specify the chain ID, but we will see this later.
